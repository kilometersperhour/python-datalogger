initial ideas:
	Datalogger writes to text file/csv, and database entries are loaded in every minute
		Collect high/low from PIR on GPIO 17 (wiringPi 0)
			Use interrupts and timers to count time between samples
			If a sample stays high after the duration that the previous result turned low in, report that as a "blocked"
		Collect serial data from Nucleo & photoresistor
			import serial
			import csv
		Collect I2C data from temp & humidity sensor
			???
			Start by reading sample code from Adafruit
